A short biography website I made to experiment with creating web pages. You can make it your own very easily by following these steps:

1. Edit the lines mentioned in the HTML-file (open it with an editor like GitHub's own Atom)
2. Edit the background image at image/background.png to something you like
3. Put it on your server and you're done!
