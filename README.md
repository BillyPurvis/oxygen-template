A short biography website I made to experiment with creating web pages. You can make it your own very easily by following these steps:

1. Edit the lines mentioned in the HTML-file (open it with an editor like GitHub's own Atom)
2. Edit the background image at image/background.webp to something you like (use the link below to convert your image to webp)
3. Put it on your server and you're done!

Have fun creating your own quick biography page!
