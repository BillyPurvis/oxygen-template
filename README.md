# Oxygen Template

A nicely designed website template you can use for your own website

Oxygen is the base of your website. Including a navigation bar, full-size background and two example body elements (one for text and one for a picture) you can easily customize it to your own preferences. Everything is licensed under the MIT license, so you can use it freely as long as you mention I made it.

A preview of the theme: http://jvnknvlgl.github.io/oxygen-template

Included files:
- index.html: the home page of your website. The example version comes with a text and a picture element.
- page-1.html: the first example page, which comes with an example text element.
- page-2.html: the second example page, which comes without any elements by default.
- style.css: the styling of the website.
- script.js: a script to center the full-size background image on mobile browsers.
- image folder: the place you can store your own images.
