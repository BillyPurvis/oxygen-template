# Oxygen Template

A nicely designed website template you can use for your own website

Oxygen is the base of your website. Including a navigation bar and two example body elements (one for text and one for a picture) you can easily customize it to your own preferences. Everything is licensed under the MIT license, so you can use it freely as long as you mention I made it.

A preview of the theme: http://jvnknvlgl.github.io/oxygen-template

Included html files:
- index.html: demo page with a picture and some text
- sub-x.html: demo pages with a secondary navigation bar
- page-2.html: demo page with two columns

Other included files:
- style.css: styling of the website
- image folder: collection of all images used on the website

- example images: pictures I've shot myself
