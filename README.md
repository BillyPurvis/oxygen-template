A short biography website I made to experiment with creating web pages. You can make it your own very easily by following these steps:

1. Edit the lines mentioned in the index.html-file and the biography.html-file (open it with an editor like GitHub's own Atom)
2. Change the background image at user-images/background.png to something you like
3. Change user-images/image.png to a picture of you, or a picture you've taken yourself
4. Put it on your server and you're done!

Have fun creating your own quick biography page!
