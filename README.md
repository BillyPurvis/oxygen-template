A short biography website I made to experiment with creating web pages.

Demo: http://jvnknvlgl.github.io/website-template/

Download the latest version from the releases page or clone my repository, and then follow these quick steps to make it your own:

1. Edit the lines mentioned in the index.html-file and the biography.html-file (open it with an markup text editor like GitHub's own Atom)
2. Change the background image at images/background.png to something you like
3. Change images/image.png to a picture of you, or a picture you've taken yourself
4. Put it on your server and you're done!
